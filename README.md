# Showcase
A repository meant to showcase my best projects!

This repository will show some of the projects I am most proud of/showcase my ability as a software engineer. These projects may come from school assignments, hackathons, or just personal projects I did in my own time.

I am licensing this repository under the MIT license, so feel free to try/use these projects on your own!
